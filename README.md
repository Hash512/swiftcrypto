Swift3 iOS Crypto with touchId and Secure Enclave
This essentially is an example code for iOS Swift Crypto. It covers
# Creating 256 ECC Keys
# Using them for Encryption & Signing
# Using them for Decryption & Verification
# Using Secure Enclave (where possible) and protecting with TouchId
# Using KeyChain and protecting access with local authentication
# Serialize and Deserialize public keys for sharing

# Using in your project
To use this easiest is to add CryptoSingleton.swift in your project, it is not designed to be thread safe for this demo, be mindful.
